title: About me

Hello! I'm Norbert, a **web developer** who used to be a **peasant** living in the countryside in southern Patagonia, where I rode goats, pigs and made my own wooden swords, bows and toys. Now still in Patagonia, but not in the prettiest region. 
I've been into the computers world since I was 9 and at 10 I got my first PC. It was a 486 with *Windows 95* and there I would start painting, recording music and playing games with it. It was a *multimedia*. :open_mouth:

In 1997 I made **my first website with FrontPage 97**, thanks to my old school with its Computer Department. It was about mountain bikes and the following years this sport took over my life and all I had in mind was that, riding through the trails that the cows made in the foothills and breath pure cold air within the mountains.

During the time I was in Bah√≠a Blanca studying **Biology Science** I started to chat online in English and I was able to make friends around the world which introduced me to **clothing textures** development for 3D avatars (the ones used in the 3D chat). At the beginning several friends helped me out and told me the steps for this process, but mainly one from New Zealand was the one who gave me the kick in the revival of my artistic side. :hushed: While we would speak about everything, she would taught me several techniques in **Photoshop** and then some tricks with **JavaScript** and **CSS** to get the flashy things done in each product page. This way I could catch the buyer's eye and sell my stuff. That was the point where I realized about my love for creating. Since then I've created textures, logos, banners, pixel art, websites, web and hybrid applications and whatever I vision in which most cases I need to learn to make my dream real.

In the uni I learned OOP, PHP (old I know), more JS and team work. Also, I've been studying German for quite a long time and a little of Japanese, of course this last language is the flippin' shieat when I don't practice it. That's why here I'll be posting according my mood.

Of course, as the geek I am, I`m into overclocking computers/ phones, anime, *toys* and more stuff that you'll have to ask me about. Oh and I love Japan.
