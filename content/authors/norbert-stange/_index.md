bio: "Hallo! \U0001F44B I'm Norbert and I'm a web developer and also designer. I used
  to be a peasant in my childhood, living in the nature with cows, chickens, goats,
  geese and an old 486 PC. Since then I've created stuff in wood, paper, soil and
  lately with code. After years of changes, in 2017 I started with my own business
  to provide my services which can be reached here Stange Studio.\n"
